    <h1>About TextMyLink Blog</h1>
    <p>
      Planning a wedding is basically a full-time job disguised as a celebration. You’re juggling RSVPs, addresses, vendors, and opinions — and still supposed to “enjoy every moment.” This blog exists to make at least one part of that easier: communicating with your guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife and I built TextMyLink while planning our own wedding. We just wanted a simple way to collect addresses and send updates without spending nights buried in spreadsheets or endless text threads. What started as a small fix for our own sanity turned into an app thousands of couples now use to text guests, gather info, and actually get responses.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blog is where we share what we’ve learned along the way — the good, the awkward, and the oddly funny side of wedding communication. We share guidance, inspiration, and real celebrations that help you collect addresses, share updates, and bring every guest into your story with grace.
    </p>

      You’ll find posts about things like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How to collect guest addresses without losing your mind</li>
      <li>What to say in a wedding reminder text</li>
      <li>How to chase RSVPs without feeling like a bill collector</li>
      <li>Why group chats always go off the rails</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We write from experience — not as experts, but as people who’ve been in the same chaos and tried to make it simpler. The goal isn’t to sell you something. It’s to help you connect with your guests in a way that feels natural, organized, and maybe even a little fun.

      If you’ve ever texted your entire family to ask for Aunt Karen’s address, this blog is for you.
