It starts innocently enough.

You get engaged, post the picture, and everyone floods your DMs with “Congrats!!”

Then your mom asks, “So… when are you sending save-the-dates?”

And suddenly, you’re not just engaged — you’re a project manager with 150 clients and one spreadsheet away from tears.

## The invisible part of wedding planning

No one warns you that before you can send anything (save-the-dates, invitations, thank-yous), you’ll need addresses. Real ones. Spelled correctly. From people who take three business quarters to text back.

You’ll probably start with good intentions — jotting down names in Notes or an Excel sheet. Then your cousin moves, your friend gets married and changes her name, and suddenly your “organized list” looks like something out of CSI.

That’s why I always tell couples: start collecting addresses the same week you pick your wedding date. It’s the task that looks small on paper but snowballs fast.

## A simple timeline that actually works

Here’s the timeline I wish someone handed me when I got engaged.

### 9–12 months before the wedding

You’ve set a date and maybe even found a venue. Great. This is your sweet spot to start collecting addresses. Send a text or link asking for mailing info. Double-check spelling and plus-ones early. Keep everything digital so you can export it later (trust me on this).

If you’re using something like [TextMyLink](https://textmylink.com/), this part can be one-and-done in a few clicks.

### 6–8 months before the wedding

Time for save-the-dates. These go out earlier than people think. Aim for six months out for local weddings, eight for destination. If you’re mailing, order them early — print timelines sneak up on you. Use your collected addresses to batch print labels or envelopes.

### 3–4 months before the wedding

The formal invitations phase. Finalize your guest list (translation: have that awkward “are they invited?” conversation). Confirm any address changes. Start tracking RSVPs as they come in.

If you’re texting RSVP links, now’s when it feels magical — one tap, one list, zero chasing.

### 1 month before the wedding

Follow-up time. Send reminders for anyone who “definitely meant to RSVP.” Check for any returned mail. Update vendors with your final headcount.

### After the wedding

You’re exhausted but grateful. Don’t lose your momentum. Save your final guest list and addresses for thank-you cards. You’ll thank yourself when you’re not trying to remember who gifted the waffle maker six weeks later.

## Why texting your guests changes everything

When we planned our wedding, we used [TextMyLink ](https://textmylink.com/)to collect addresses — and honestly, it changed everything. I’ve seen every which way that people try to ask for someone’s address, and some of them get pretty creative. Here are a few of my top versions:

“Hey, what’s your address again? We’re sending invites.”
“Hi! Can you text me your mailing address?”
“Hey man, what’s your address? Need it for something fun.”
“Hi! We’re working on invites and realized I don’t have your address.”
“Hey... sending out wedding stuff, what’s your best mailing address?”

They all work… eventually. But sending that message over and over gets old fast.

That’s what made us build [TextMyLink ](https://textmylink.com/)— so you could send one simple message, have everyone fill out their info, and store it in one clean list. No endless follow-ups, no typos, no guilt-texts to your college roommate.

If you’re deep in address chaos right now, don’t overthink it. A single link or mass text saves hours. It’s not about being perfectly organized — it’s about staying sane.

## Takeaway

If you’re knee-deep in wedding planning, remember: everything takes longer than you expect… except the part where your guests actually respond (that somehow takes even longer).

Start early, keep it simple, and give yourself permission to make it easier. A few texts today will save you a few headaches tomorrow.
