<p>You said yes. Now what? Here’s how to start planning your wedding without spiraling into spreadsheets and panic texts.</p>

<p>There’s nothing quite like that first week after getting engaged. You’re still staring at your hand like it’s a newborn. Your phone’s blowing up with “OMG congrats!!!” texts. And then… someone says the words <em>“Have you picked a date yet?”</em></p>

<p>That’s when the calm ends and the planning begins.</p>

<p>If you’re reading this, you’re probably somewhere between giddy and mildly panicked. That’s normal. Every couple goes through that “now what?” moment. The good news? You don’t need a binder, a wedding coordinator, or an espresso-fueled all-nighter. You just need a few grounded steps to start right.</p>



<h2>The first 10 things that actually matter</h2>



<h3>1. Take a breath and celebrate</h3>

<p>Don’t open Pinterest yet. Seriously. Pour a glass of something, call your best friend, and just <em>be engaged</em> for at least 24 hours. The planning can wait.</p>



<h3>2. Tell your people</h3>

<p>Start with the inner circle — parents, siblings, closest friends. They’ll want to hear it from you, not Instagram.</p>



<h3>3. Set your rough timeline</h3>

<p>Are you picturing a fall wedding next year or a quick spring celebration? A rough window helps guide every other decision.</p>



<h3>4. Talk budget early</h3>

<p>Not romantic, but it’s peace of mind in disguise. Even a ballpark number helps narrow down venues, guest count, and expectations before things snowball.</p>



<h3>5. Draft a first guest list</h3>

<p>Don’t overthink it. Just write names as they come to mind — anyone you could <em>see</em> being there. You’ll edit later, but this first list sets the scale for everything else.</p>



<h3>6. Start collecting addresses</h3>

<p>This one sneaks up on everyone. It sounds simple, but asking 100 people for their address is the first real “project” of wedding planning. And it grows fast. Use <a href="https://www.textmylink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TextMyLink</a> to collect them in one click instead of chasing replies for weeks.</p>

<h3>7. Choose your top 3 priorities</h3>

<p>Decide what matters most to both of you. Maybe it’s food, photos, or the band. Knowing your must-haves makes it easier to cut costs or stress elsewhere.</p>



<h3>8. Create a shared planning doc</h3>

<p>Even a simple Google Sheet or shared Notes list helps you both stay aligned. It’s also a sanity saver when family asks, “What can I help with?”</p>



<h3>9. Pick your date and start venue searching</h3>

<p>Once you know your season and rough guest count, venues will start falling into or out of range. Availability does most of the deciding for you.</p>



<h3>10. Enjoy being fiancés</h3>

<p>There’s no prize for planning the fastest. The best part of engagement is the in-between — not newly dating, not yet married — just this happy, buzzing middle stage. Don’t skip it.</p>



<h2>The calm before the checklist storm</h2>

<p>You don’t need to have everything figured out. The first month isn’t about execution, it’s about direction. You’re setting the tone for how you want this whole process to feel.</p>

<p>If you start calm, you’ll stay calm. If you start in spreadsheet-mode, you’ll end up chasing perfection… and that’s where wedding planning gets messy.</p>

<p>Think of this stage as building your foundation. Everything else — RSVPs, seating charts, texts to vendors — can flow naturally once you’ve got your base in place.</p>

<p><em>If you’re freshly engaged, congrats. You’re already doing great just by reading this instead of panic-Googling “wedding checklist PDF.” Start simple, send a few texts, and remember… this is supposed to be fun.</em></p>

<p><strong>A few calm decisions now will save you from chaos later.</strong></p>
