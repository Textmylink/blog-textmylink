<h1>How to Collect Guest Info Once (and Use It Forever)</h1>

<p>Most couples think of wedding planning in phases. Save-the-dates. Invitations. RSVPs. Thank-yous. Each one gets its own list, its own little spreadsheet, and its own round of chaos.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing, you don’t need a new list every time. You just need <strong>one good one</strong>.</p>



<h2>The never-ending loop of address collecting</h2>

<p>If you’ve been engaged for more than a week, you’ve probably already texted someone for their address. Then you’ll do it again when it’s time for invitations. And again for thank-yous. And maybe one more time for their birthday because it’s the only address you sorta remember.</p>

<p>I used to do that. My Notes app looked like a scavenger hunt. Names, half addresses, random emojis as reminders. Until I realized it could all be one thing... one list I actually keep up with.</p>



<h2>Build it once, use it forever</h2>

<p>Here’s how to make it simple:</p>

<ol>

  <li><strong>Collect everything the first time.</strong> Don’t just ask for mailing addresses. Ask for their email, phone, and plus-one’s name too. You’ll thank yourself later when you need it for RSVPs or thank-you notes. If wording the first message feels awkward, use these friendly templates: <a href="https://blog.textmylink.com/posts/how-to-ask-for-addresses-politely-without-sounding-like-a-robot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to ask for addresses politely</a>.</li>

  <li><strong>Keep it in one place.</strong> Whether it’s a spreadsheet or an app like <a href="https://www.textmylink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TextMyLink</a>, your goal is to have a single home for guest info. TextMyLink makes it easy because your guests fill in their own info through a link, it stores it automatically, and it ensures everything is accurate... including the correct spellings of names.</li>

  <li><strong>Update, don’t rebuild.</strong> After the wedding, don’t delete it. That same list becomes your birthday list, your holiday card list, and your friend-moved-to-Austin-and-needs-a-new-address list. If you’re wondering when to start the whole process, here’s a simple timeline: <a href="https://blog.textmylink.com/posts/when-to-collect-wedding-addresses-and-everything-else-that-sneaks-up-on-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when to collect wedding addresses</a>.</li>

</ol>



<h2>Why this saves your sanity</h2>

<p>Every couple thinks they’ll “just make a new list” for the next step. But that’s how you end up hunting through texts at midnight. Having one good, organized list early on saves hours later... especially when you’re sending hundreds of thank-you cards and don’t want to play detective again.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t believe how many times I’ve looked back at the addresses I collected for our wedding... for thank-yous, holiday cards, and random little moments when I wanted to stay in touch. That one list keeps paying off.</p>

<p>Plus, it feels oddly satisfying to watch the same list grow with your life. Friends move, new family members join, and that spreadsheet becomes a little time capsule of everyone who’s been part of your story.</p>



<h2>Takeaway</h2>

<p>You don’t need to start over every time you send mail. Just start once, start right, and keep it updated.</p>

<p>If you’re knee-deep in guest lists right now, you’re doing great. The future you... the one mailing thank-yous and holiday cards... will be very, very grateful.</p>
