It’s one of those small wedding tasks that somehow feels way harder than it should.

You open your phone, type “Hey, what’s your address?”… and then backspace it immediately because it sounds too blunt.

You rewrite it three times, add emojis, take them out, and still feel awkward hitting send.

It’s funny, you can ask someone for their favorite cocktail, but asking for their address feels intimate. Like you’re crossing into official adult territory.

I’ve seen it all — the polite, the funny, the slightly chaotic. So if you’re staring at your screen wondering how to make this simple, here’s what actually works.

**Why this message matters more than you think**

Your first address request sets the tone for everything that comes next — invites, RSVPs, updates, even thank-yous. It’s the first touchpoint that says, hey, we’re officially doing this thing.

And yet, it’s also where things start to unravel.

People forget to reply.

They text back, “oh shoot, we moved!”

Or they send “it’s 123 Main St, wait no, make that my parents’ address.”

That’s why it helps to keep your ask short, kind, and clear… and to use a system like [TextMyLink ](https://textmylink.com/)that keeps everything organized (instead of fifty different text threads).

**What to actually say**

Here are a few real examples — no copy-paste corporate tone, just simple messages that sound like you:

If you’re going for friendly and casual:

“Hey! We’re getting ready to send wedding invites and realized we don’t have your current address. Can you text it back real quick?”

If you want to sound a little more formal:

“Hi! Hope you’re doing well. We’re starting to prep for wedding invites and would love to confirm your mailing address when you get a chance.”

If you’d rather skip the awkwardness altogether:

“Hey! We’re collecting addresses for our wedding, could you please fill in your information in this link below? [TextMyLink.com/YourEventName](https://textmylink.com/mywedding)”

Or

“Hey, can you fill in the link below so we can get your address? Formal invitation to follow! \
[TextMyLink.com/YourEventName](https://textmylink.com/mywedding)

The truth is, no one minds being asked — they just need an easy way to respond. That’s why I always tell couples to make it one-click simple with [TextMyLink](https://textmylink.com/).

**A few etiquette tips (learned the hard way)**

1. Ask early.

Start collecting addresses right after you set your date. The longer you wait, the more you’ll be chasing down last-minute updates.

2. Don’t overthink your tone.

If you’re worried about sounding too casual, you’re probably already being polite. Just keep it genuine.

3. Send reminders kindly.

A week later, a gentle nudge works:

“Hey just wanted to bump this in case it got buried — no rush, but I’m finishing up invites soon!”

4. Keep it organized.

Whether you’re using a spreadsheet or [TextMyLink](https://textmylink.com/), have one master list where everything lands automatically. The less copy-pasting, the better.

**My personal favorite approach**

When we did our wedding, I used [TextMyLink ](https://textmylink.com/)and sent one simple mass text.

No group chat chaos, no losing addresses in screenshots.

Everyone got their own message with a link to fill out their info, and I just watched the replies roll in.

It felt personal and efficient… like magic for Type-A personalities and procrastinators alike.

**Takeaway**

Asking for addresses doesn’t have to feel like an awkward text from middle school.

Be kind, be yourself, and make it easy for people to reply.

A few short messages now will save you hours later — and maybe even your sanity.

If you’re knee-deep in guest lists right now, you’re doing great. A few texts really can make the whole thing feel easier.
