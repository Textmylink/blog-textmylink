There’s a moment in every wedding timeline when you realize… half your guest list still hasn’t RSVP’d.

You’ve already extended the deadline once, your caterer is asking for final numbers, and your mom’s calling to ask if Aunt Bobbie ever replied.

I’ve been there. We initially used [TextMyLink ](https://textmylink.com/)to collect addresses for our save the dates and invitations. Later, we used it again to chase the people who never RSVP’d. Spoiler: they exist in every wedding.

It’s not that people are bad at replying. They’re just busy. They see the message, think “I’ll do it later,” and suddenly it’s three weeks later.

That’s why timing and tone matter way more than guilt trips.

**Why people forget to RSVP**

It’s not personal. Most people don’t even realize how much coordination goes into a wedding guest list.

A few things that usually happen:

They think their partner already replied.

They can’t decide if they can make it.

They saw your message while in line at Trader Joe’s and never circled back.

So when you remind them, it’s not nagging… it’s doing them a favor.

**The right way to send a reminder**

Here’s the trick: sound more like a friend, less like a spreadsheet. You’re just checking in, not scolding anyone.

Pro tip: Send a friendly reminder about a week before your RSVP deadline. People need nudges more than they need guilt trips.

Here are a few examples that work well:

Simple & Kind:

Hey! Just a heads up our RSVP deadline is coming up this week. No rush, just wanted to make sure you got the invite link!

Funny & Real:

It’s me again… your friendly neighborhood bride/groom checking in to see if you’re joining the party. RSVP link’s here just in case.

Direct but Polite:

Hi! Our caterer’s asking for final numbers, so if you haven’t RSVP’d yet, could you do it by Friday? Thanks so much!

**Why TextMyLink makes reminders easy**

Sending 100 individual messages one by one is the definition of wedding chaos.

With [TextMyLink](https://textmylink.com/), you can send a reminder to everyone at once, privately. Each guest gets their own text and/or RSVP link — no messy group chats, no missed messages.

It’s quick, easy, and doesn’t come off as automated because you write it in your own voice. You can even see who’s replied, so you’re not guessing who’s still in RSVP limbo.

\
Plus, because your link is customizable, guests can update their info, add plus-ones, or confirm attendance — all in one place.

**What not to do**

Don’t send reminders in a group chat. Someone will say “I already RSVP’d” and it gets awkward.

Don’t assume no response means yes. Always confirm.

Don’t overthink your wording. A friendly tone beats perfect phrasing every time.

**Takeaway**

Most people just need a small nudge. The ones who love you already want to be there — they just need a reminder at the right time, said the right way.

So take a deep breath, send that message, and move on to the fun stuff.

You’ve got a wedding to plan, not a census to manage.
