<h1>How to Collect Wedding Guest Addresses Without Chasing Anyone</h1>

<p>This whole thing started with a text.</p>

<p>A friend asked me for my address so he could send a wedding invitation. Totally normal. After I replied, we kept talking about wedding planning and he casually mentioned he had already texted over 50 people for their addresses… and still had more to go.</p>

<p>Then came the part that hurt.</p>

<p>He had to retype every single address into a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>No system. No form. Just texts, screenshots, and copy paste. I remember thinking, <em>there has to be a better way to do this.</em> A few months later, while planning my own wedding, I realized there wasn’t.</p>

<p>So we built one.</p>

<h2>Why collecting addresses is sneakily one of the worst wedding tasks</h2>

<p>It doesn’t sound stressful. Until you start.</p>

<p>Here’s what usually happens:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Addresses come in texts, emails, Instagram DMs, and group chats</li>
  <li>Some people forget apartment numbers</li>
  <li>Some reply weeks later with “Did I already send this?”</li>
  <li>You end up second guessing every entry before printing invitations</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s not hard work. It’s annoying work. And it adds up fast.</p>

<p>That’s the gap <a href="https://www.textmylink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TextMyLink</a> was built to solve.</p>

<h2>What TextMyLink actually does</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.textmylink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TextMyLink</a>
  lets you collect wedding guest addresses through one simple text.
</p>

<p>You create a link. You text it to your guests. They tap it and fill out their own information.</p>

<p>That’s it.</p>

<p>No copying. No spreadsheets full of mystery typos. No wondering if you spelled someone’s last name wrong.</p>

<p>Everything gets saved automatically in one place and can be exported whenever you’re ready for save the dates, invitations, or thank you cards.</p>

<h2>Why texting works better than email</h2>

<p>This isn’t a hot take. It’s just reality.</p>

<p>People open texts. People respond to texts. And people do not ignore texts for weeks the way they do emails.</p>

<p>Wedding guest communication works best when it feels personal and familiar. A text feels like a normal conversation, not a task.</p>

<p>That’s why wedding texting has become such a big part of stress free wedding planning. You’re meeting guests where they already are, on their phones.</p>

<h2>What your guests actually see</h2>

<p>This part matters.</p>

<p>Guests don’t download anything. They don’t log in. They don’t get overwhelmed.</p>

<p>They tap a link and see a clean, simple page asking for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Address</li>
  <li>RSVP, if you want it</li>
  <li>Any extra details you choose to collect</li>
</ul>

<p>They fill it out in under a minute and move on with their day.</p>

<p>
  And because they typed it themselves, you’re not guessing how to spell “Boulevard,”
  whether “Apt 3B” was included, or whether Rachel is spelled Rachael or Rachel.
</p>

<p>You get clean data. They don’t feel annoyed. Everyone wins.</p>

<h2>When couples usually use TextMyLink</h2>

<p>Most couples start using it when they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are getting ready to send save the dates</li>
  <li>Want to collect addresses early before invitations</li>
  <li>Need a better way to handle RSVPs</li>
  <li>Are tired of chasing people for information</li>
</ul>

<p>Some couples even keep using it after the wedding to send thank you cards or keep an updated address list for the future.</p>

<h2>Why we built it this way</h2>

<p>TextMyLink wasn’t built in a boardroom. It was built because we were the customer.</p>

<p>We didn’t want a complicated wedding website. We didn’t want another spreadsheet to manage. And we definitely didn’t want a tool that felt heavy or corporate.</p>

<p>We wanted something fast, simple, and done in five minutes.</p>

<p>So that’s what we made.</p>

<h2>The honest takeaway</h2>

<p>If you’re wondering how to collect addresses for a wedding and feeling weirdly overwhelmed by it, that makes sense. This part sneaks up on people.</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.textmylink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TextMyLink</a>
  exists because this problem is real and way more common than people admit.
</p>

<p>If you’re knee deep in guest lists right now, you’re doing great. A single text really can make this part of wedding planning feel a whole lot lighter.</p>
