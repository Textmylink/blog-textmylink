It’s around this time of year when most couples realize… wow, the wedding is *actually happening.*

You’ve booked the venue, maybe even found your dress, and your parents keep asking about hotel blocks. But somewhere between RSVPs and flower quotes, a few details quietly slipped through the cracks.

This isn’t a guilt trip — it’s a reset. A quick mid-year “how are we doing?” before the sprint to the finish.

## 1. Guest list check + RSVP follow-ups

You probably *think* your guest list is final. But a few people have moved, changed emails, or never got around to RSVPing.

This is the perfect time to **double-check your list and send a quick round of reminders.**

If you used [TextMyLink](https://textmylink.com/), you can do both very quickly — verify everyone’s address and send out a friendly “Hey, just just a reminder to RSVP!” text in a few clicks. It’s an easy way to stay organized and contact guests quickly.

Guests appreciate a nudge more than you think. And you’ll appreciate not wondering whether Uncle Joe ever saw your invite.

## 2. Vendor coordination

At some point, you’ll realize your vendors have never actually spoken to each other.

Your planner knows the DJ’s setup time, but the photographer doesn’t. The caterer needs table counts, but you’re still waiting on final RSVPs.

Take 30 minutes this week to send one group email or text thread confirming arrival times, addresses, and contact info.

That small effort now can save you from the day-of chaos where you’re trying to answer your phone with a makeup brush in hand.

## 3. Postage and printing (the quiet money sink)

You’ve got your invitation designs ready… and then you realize stamps cost more than you expected and half your envelopes weigh too much.

Before you send 150 invites back to the post office, **do a test mail.**

We learned this the hard way. One thicker envelope came back crumpled, and I remember thinking, “If I have to redo this, I might elope.”

A little prep here saves both time and sanity.

## 4. Hotel blocks and transportation

If you have out-of-town guests, hotel blocks disappear fast — especially during busy wedding weekends.

Even if you booked yours months ago, confirm your room block still has space and that the rates are correct.

While you’re at it, double-check transportation plans. Do guests know how to get from the ceremony to the reception? Are you covered if rideshares are scarce?

It’s not glamorous planning, but it’s the kind your future self will thank you for.

## 5. The seating chart that only exists in your head

You *think* you know where everyone’s going to sit — until you actually start dragging names around. Suddenly you’re in a game of social Tetris.

It’s easy to postpone, but starting now saves you from the “we can’t put Aunt Lisa near Uncle Jeff” panic later.

Use a spreadsheet to group people by table or connection (college friends, family, coworkers). It doesn’t have to be perfect yet — just start sketching it out while you still have brain space.

## 6. Your ceremony and reception timeline (a.k.a. the day’s heartbeat)

Vendors love when couples have even a rough timeline early on. It doesn’t have to be minute-by-minute — just a simple flow: ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner, dancing.

Creating it now gives your planner or coordinator something to refine later and helps you spot gaps (like that awkward 45-minute lull between photos and dinner).

Once it’s written down, you can stop mentally replaying it every night before bed.

## 7. The thank-you system no one talks about

Thank-you cards always sound like a “later” problem… until later arrives and you’re staring at 100 blank envelopes.

Start tracking gifts and addresses as they come in — especially from showers or early presents.

If you already used [TextMyLink ](https://textmylink.com/)for addresses, add a quick column for gifts or notes. You’ll thank yourself later when you’re not piecing it together post-honeymoon. That address list will come in handy for invites and thank you cards.

## 8. Budget drift (and how to pull it back)

At some point, every couple hits the moment where the numbers start… drifting.

You added a few extra guests, upgraded the chairs, and suddenly the spreadsheet you swore you’d stick to feels like a polite suggestion.

Now’s the perfect time for a **mid-year money check-in.**

Open your budget (or start one if you’ve been winging it) and see what’s left versus what’s coming. You might find small ways to rebalance — like trimming décor items no one will notice or swapping the photo booth for a DIY setup.

It’s not about cutting joy. It’s about **spending intentionally** on the things you actually care about.

And if that’s late-night tacos… defend those tacos proudly.

## 9. The forgotten to-do list

You know that random sticky note on your fridge that says “follow up with caterer”? Or the half-finished “misc” section at the bottom of your wedding spreadsheet?

Yeah — now’s the time to look at those.

Little things tend to pile up and stay unfinished: confirming song choices, checking vendor deposits, finalizing signage wording.

Take 20 minutes to scroll through old emails and texts for any loose ends you promised to “get to later.” You’ll be amazed how much mental clutter it clears.

## 10. Taking care of *you*

Somewhere between meal charts and centerpiece inspo, it’s easy to forget the whole point — you’re getting married.

Schedule a night with your partner that has *nothing* to do with the wedding. No spreadsheets. No Pinterest. Just dinner, a walk, maybe talking about something else for a change.

Planning can take over everything if you let it. Don’t.

### The Takeaway

You’re doing better than you think.

A few loose ends don’t mean you’re behind — it means you’re human.

Check your list, send a few texts, maybe laugh at how your “simple guest list” turned into a part-time job.

If you’re halfway through planning, take this as your permission to breathe… and then get back to it, one small fix at a time.

Because a few texts really can make the whole thing easier.
