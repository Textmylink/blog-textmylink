It started with a simple text: 


“Hey, what’s your address? I’m sending wedding invites.”


I sent it back without thinking much of it. Then I replied again, asking about details — his venue, how excited he was, how it was all coming together. Somewhere in that conversation, it hit me… he must have sent this same message to fifty people.

That tiny moment — a groom trying to collect addresses — was the spark for **TextMyLink**.

## The chaos behind “Hey, what’s your address?”

If you’ve ever planned a wedding, you know that one text multiplies fast. You start with ten people. Then it’s fifty. Then your mom wants her friends added. Suddenly you’ve got screenshots, random notes, and a spreadsheet that looks like it’s been through battle.

It’s such a small part of wedding planning, but it eats up so much time. You can’t send save-the-dates, RSVPs, or even thank-you cards without it. And everyone you ask promises to “text it later,” which usually means… never.

That’s when I realized — this wasn’t just my friend’s problem. This was *every couple’s* problem.

## The idea that wouldn’t leave me alone

A few months later, when my own engagement came around, I saw the mess firsthand.

I was that guy now — getting ready to send the same message over and over, retyping every address into Excel, double-checking spellings, realizing too late that “Aunt Debbie” now lives in Florida.

So I built something to fix it.

TextMyLink started as a weekend project between me and my fiancée (now wife). We didn’t set out to start a business. We just wanted a simple way to text everyone one link, have them fill out their info, and be done. No chasing. No spreadsheets.

We used it for our own wedding. It worked beautifully. And somewhere between sending invites and planning seating charts, we realized… this could help other couples too.

## Why we built it ourselves

Most apps out there were made by companies who never had to actually *use* them. We built ours mid-planning, between RSVP lists and late-night coffee. Every feature came from a real moment — like realizing we forgot someone’s plus-one name or needing to send a reminder text the night before.

That’s the whole point of **TextMyLink**: *real people solving real wedding chaos.*

It’s not fancy. It’s not trying to be. It’s just the easiest way to collect addresses, track RSVPs, and send updates without losing your mind (or your spreadsheet).

## Looking ahead

This blog isn’t here to sell you something. It’s here to help. We’ll share stories, templates, and honest lessons from planning — the awkward guest texts, the timing mistakes, and the little wins that make it all worth it.

If you’re reading this, maybe you’re in the middle of it. Maybe you’re still deciding who’s on your guest list or figuring out how to politely ask for addresses. Either way, you’re not alone.

**If you’re knee-deep in wedding planning right now, you’re doing great. A few texts really can make the whole thing feel easier.**
