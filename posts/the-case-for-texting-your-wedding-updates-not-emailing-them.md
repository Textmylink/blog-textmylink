<p>There’s a point in every wedding where your inbox becomes your enemy. You’re sending one update about shuttle times, one about weather, and somehow Aunt Deb is replying to an email from three months ago asking if she can still bring her friend “from the gym.”</p>



<p>It’s not your fault. Email feels official… until you realize half your guests don’t check it regularly and the other half have 27,000 unread messages.</p>



<p>Texting, on the other hand? People actually see it.</p>



<h2>The problem with email</h2>



<p>When we were planning our wedding, I spent way too much time writing what looked like customer support tickets: “Hi everyone! Just a quick note about the venue parking situation…”</p>



<p>No one read them. I’d get three replies from the same cousin asking for the address that was literally in the subject line.</p>



<p>And honestly, you probably don’t even have everyone’s email address. Most of your guests live in your phone, not your inbox. You end up texting them first just to ask for their email… and at that point, you might as well have sent the update right there in the text.</p>



<p>That’s when I started texting updates instead — things like, “Hey! Ceremony’s outdoors, bring a jacket 😊” — and suddenly, everyone was in the loop.</p>



<p>Because honestly… plans change. A lot. The venue shifts times, weather rolls in, shuttles get delayed, or your cousin books the wrong hotel. Texting makes it easy to keep everyone updated in real time — no “oops, didn’t see your email” moments.</p>



<p><strong>Texts don’t get buried.</strong> They’re opened in seconds. The average text open rate is insanely high compared to email. Email wishes it had that kind of attention span.</p>



<h2>Why texting just works better</h2>



<p>Aside from actually getting read, texting feels more human. It’s how you already talk to your guests. It fits the tone of a wedding… personal, quick, and easy.</p>



<p>Here’s what texting does right:</p>



<ul>

  <li><strong>It cuts through the noise.</strong> No spam filters or promotions tabs.</li>

  <li><strong>It keeps everyone in one place.</strong> You’re not juggling five email threads and reply-alls.</li>

  <li><strong>It feels personal.</strong> A short text sounds like it’s from you, not “The Wedding Committee.”</li>

  <li><strong>It saves you time.</strong> Write once, send to all, move on with your day.</li>

</ul>



<p>And it’s not just for reminders. You can text:</p>



<ul>

  <li>Directions to the ceremony</li>

  <li>Dress code updates</li>

  <li>Shuttle times and pickup spots</li>

  <li>Weather warnings</li>

  <li>After-party details</li>

</ul>



<p>Basically, all the things guests don’t remember from your wedding website.</p>



<h2>How to do it right</h2>



<p>Texting your guests doesn’t mean spamming them. It just means keeping things simple and direct.</p>



<p>If you’re texting individually, keep it short and friendly:</p>



<p>“Hey! Just a quick reminder to RSVP when you get a sec 😊”</p>

<p>“Hi friends! Forecast says light rain — ceremony’s still outdoors, bring umbrellas!”</p>



<p>If you don’t want to copy and paste the same message 80 times, you can use a tool like <a href="https://www.textmylink.com">TextMyLink</a> that lets you send one message to everyone at once. Each guest gets it separately so it still feels personal, and you can see who’s replied and who hasn’t without chasing people one by one.</p>



<h2>The new etiquette of wedding texting</h2>



<p>Texting your guests used to feel weird. Now it’s expected. Everyone texts. The formality of your wedding doesn’t have to carry into how you communicate about it.</p>



<p>The key is tone:</p>



<ul>

  <li>Be kind, not bossy.</li>

  <li>Be brief, not blunt.</li>

  <li>Always say who you are if it’s a big group send. A quick “Hi! It’s Jess and Mark” goes a long way.</li>

</ul>



<p>Guests want to know what’s going on. They just want to hear it in the same format they use every day.</p>



<h2>Takeaway</h2>



<p>Wedding planning is already a full-time job. You don’t need to add “Director of Guest Communications” to your title.</p>



<p>Text your updates. Keep it simple.</p>



<p>Your guests will actually read them. You’ll save hours. And nobody will ever reply-all again.</p>



<p>If you’re curious how other couples are doing it, <a href="https://www.weddingchicks.com/wedding-invitations-tips/how-to-collect-guest-addresses-in-one-easy-step/">Wedding Chicks</a> even wrote about how easy it is to collect guest addresses using TextMyLink — and honestly, they summed it up perfectly.</p>



<p>If you’re juggling RSVPs, addresses, and last-minute changes right now, you’re doing great. A few thoughtful texts really can make the whole thing feel easier.</p>
