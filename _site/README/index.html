<h2>Handling large command output in the Codex shell</h2>
<p>If a command prints a line longer than 4,096 bytes, Codex stops the session
with an error similar to:</p>
<pre><code>Error: Output for session 'shell' contained a line exceeding the max of 4096
bytes (observed at least 14414 bytes).
</code></pre>
<p>To avoid this, rerun the command while constraining the output size. Common
approaches include piping the command through tools such as <code>grep</code>, <code>jq</code>, or
<code>cut</code>, or redirecting the output to a file for later inspection. When working
with build logs, consider filtering to the lines you need (e.g. <code>grep -nE</code> for
pattern matches) or truncating very long lines with <code>cut -c1-200</code>.</p>
